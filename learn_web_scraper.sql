It is also a break from Mr. Biden’s predecessors, who were reluctant to anger a country of strategic importance and were wary of driving its leadership toward American adversaries like Russia or Iran.</p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">The Turkish government, as well as human rights activists and ethnic Armenians, gave a muted response to the news, which leaked days in advance, describing the move as largely symbolic.</p></div><aside class=\"css-ew4tgv\" aria-label=\"companion column\"></aside></div><div class=\"css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn\"><div class=\"css-53u6y8\"><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who has repeatedly denied that the killings amounted to genocide, had lobbied hard to prevent the announcement, mounting a conference and media campaigns before the anniversary on Saturday.</p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">But when Mr. Biden spoke with Mr. Erdogan on Friday, the pair had agreed only to an “effective management of disagreements,” according to a summary of the conversation provided by the White House. A statement from the Turkish presidency said both leaders agreed on the “importance of working together.” The two are scheduled to meet at a summit of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in June.</p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">During their call, Mr. Biden told Mr. Erdogan directly that he would be declaring the massacre an act of genocide, according to a person familiar with the discussion who spoke on the condition of anonymity to disclose details of the conversation.</p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">“We affirm the history,” Mr. Biden said in his statement on Saturday. “We do this not to cast blame but to ensure that what happened is never repeated.”</p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">Since taking office, Mr. Biden has kept Mr. Erdogan at a distance, calling other world leaders — and leaving his Turkish counterpart, who enjoyed a friendly relationship with President Donald J.

But political analysts said he was likely to tread carefully with the United States.</p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">Relations between the countries have reached their lowest point in decades, as Mr. Erdogan has turned increasingly combative in his dealings with Washington, particularly after a failed coup in 2016. Mr. Erdogan has blamed the bid to oust him from power on a Turkish cleric <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/20/world/europe/fethullah-gulen-erdogan-extradition.html\" title=\"\">living in self-imposed exile in rural Pennsylvania</a>, and by extension on the United States.</p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">Tensions escalated with Turkey’s deal to buy <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/12/world/europe/turkey-russia-missile-deal.html\" title=\"\">a missile system from Russia</a> in 2017, which prompted the Trump administration to <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/14/us/politics/trump-turkey-missile-defense-sanctions.html\" title=\"\">impose sanctions on Turkey</a> in December. Syria, too, has been a flash point.

That view has fueled a greater geopolitical assertiveness demonstrated in military interventions in Syria, Libya, Iraq and Azerbaijan and <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/27/world/europe/greece-turkey-eu.html\" title=\"\">in exploration for energy in contested waters</a> in the eastern Mediterranean last year.</p></div><aside class=\"css-ew4tgv\" aria-label=\"companion column\"></aside></div><div class=\"css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn\"><div class=\"css-53u6y8\"><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">European leaders and members of the Biden administration advocate continued engagement with Mr. Erdogan’s government because Turkey houses millions of Syrian refugees who might otherwise head to Europe.

Worried that the Christian Armenian population would align with Russia, a primary enemy of the Ottoman Turks, officials ordered mass deportations in what many historians consider the first genocide of the 20th century: Nearly 1.5 million Armenians were killed, some in massacres by soldiers and the police, others in forced exoduses to the Syrian desert that left them starved to death.</p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">Turkey has acknowledged that widespread atrocities occurred during that period, but its leaders have adamantly denied that the killings were genocide.</p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">In the days leading up to Mr. Biden’s announcement, Armenians and human rights activists in Turkey expressed caution, partly because of years of political seesawing over the issue.</p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">“Personally, it is not going to make me excited,” Yetvart Danzikyan, the editor in chief of Agos, an Armenian-Turkish weekly newspaper in Istanbul, said, pointing to a statement President Ronald Reagan issued in 1981 about the Holocaust that mentioned the “genocide of the Armenians” in passing.</p></div><aside class=\"css-ew4tgv\" aria-label=\"companion column\"></aside></div><div class=\"css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn\"><div class=\"css-53u6y8\"><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">Murat Celikkan, a journalist and longtime human rights activist, said the declaration would be good for American-Armenian citizens, but he did not expect it to change attitudes in Turkey or encourage reconciliation between Turks and Armenians.</p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">“It did not change with more than 20 countries officially recognizing it, including Germany,” he said.</p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">In the United States, some Armenian activists welcomed the declaration as a step forward.</p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">“The denial of the genocide has been such a painful chapter,” said Bryan Ardouny, the executive director of the Armenian Assembly of America. “This is a really critical moment in the arc of history, in defense of human rights.”</p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">“The president is standing firmly against basically a century of denial and is charting a new course,” he said. </p><p class=\"css-pncxxs etfikam0\">Katie Rogers<!-- --> reported from Washington, and <!-- -->Carlotta Gall<!-- --> from Istanbul. <!-- -->Giulia McDonnell Nieto del Rio<!-- --> contributed reporting from New York.</p></div><aside class=\"css-ew4tgv\" aria-label=\"companion column\"></aside></div><div></div>', 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/04/23/us/politics/00dc-genocide-1/00dc-genocide-1-thumbWide.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale', 'https://www.nytimes.com//2021/04/24/us/politics/biden-genocide-armenia-turkey.html', 1, 1, '2021-04-25 04:10:49', '2021-04-25 04:10:49'),

That divide is helping to fuel opposition from corporations that are based in or have work forces in those places.</p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">In Texas, Republicans have taken the rare tack of outlining restrictions that would apply only to counties with population of more than one million, targeting the booming and increasingly diverse metropolitan areas of Houston, Austin, San Antonio and Dallas. </p></div><aside class=\"css-ew4tgv\" aria-label=\"companion column\"></aside></div><div class=\"css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn\"><div class=\"css-53u6y8\"><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">The Republican focus on diverse urban areas, voting activists say, evokes the state’s history of racially discriminatory voting laws — including poll taxes and “white primary” laws during the Jim Crow era — that essentially excluded Black voters from the electoral process.</p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">Most of Harris County’s early voters were white, according to <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://twitter.com/txcivilrights/status/1375869409919700997?s=21\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">a study by the Texas Civil Rights Project</a>, a nonprofit group. But the majority of those who used drive-through or 24-hour voting — the early voting methods the Republican bills would prohibit — were people of color, the group found. </p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">“It’s clear they are trying to make it harder for people to vote who face everyday circumstances, especially things like poverty and other situations,” said Chris Hollins, a Democrat and the former interim clerk of Harris County, who oversaw and implemented many of the policies during the November election. “With 24-hour voting, there wasn’t even claims or a legal challenge during the election.”</p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">The effort to further restrict voting in Texas is taking place against the backdrop of an increasingly tense showdown between legislators and Texas-based corporations, with Republicans in the House proposing financial retribution for companies that have spoken out.</p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\"><a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://news.aa.com/news/news-details/2021/American-Airlines-Statement-on-Texas-Voting-Legislation-CORP-OTH-04/default.aspx\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">American Airlines</a> and <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://twitter.com/MichaelDell/status/1377709961149620236?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1377709961149620236%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.crn.com%2Fnews%2Fdata-center%2Fmichael-dell-slams-texas-voting-bill-as-opposite-of-democracy\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Dell Technologies</a> both voiced strong opposition to the bill, and AT&amp;T issued a statement supporting “voting laws that make it easier for more Americans to vote,” though it did not specifically mention Texas.</p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">American Airlines also dispatched Jack McCain, the son of former Senator John McCain, to lobby Republicans in Austin to roll back some of the more stringent restrictions.</p><div id=\"NYT_MAIN_CONTENT_2_REGION\" class=\"css-9tf9ac\"></div><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">Republicans in the State Legislature appear unbowed.

Even with unlikely odds of passing, simply placing the proposals<em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\"> </em>on the record is seen by lobbyists and operatives in Austin as a thinly veiled warning to businesses to stay quiet on the voting bills.</p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">The Perryman Group, an economic research and analysis firm based in Waco, <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.perrymangroup.com/publications/brief/2021/04/09/the-potential-economic-impact-of-legislation-restricting-voter-access-on-business-activity-in-texas/\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">said in a recent study</a> that implementing controversial voting measures could lead to conferences or events being pulled from the state, and prompt businesses or workers to shun it. The group estimated that restrictive new laws would lead to a huge decrease in business activity in the state by 2025 and cost tens of thousands of jobs. </p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">Among the restrictions in two omnibus bills in the Texas Legislature are a ban on 24-hour voting, a ban on drive-through voting and harsh criminal penalties for local election officials who provide assistance to voters. There are also new limits on voting machine distribution that could lead to a reduction in numbers of precincts and a ban on encouraging absentee voting.</p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">The bills also include a measure that would make it much more difficult to remove a poll watcher for improper conduct. Partisan poll watchers, who are trained and authorized to observe the election on behalf of a candidate or party, have occasionally crossed the line into voter intimidation or other types of misbehavior; Harris County elections officials said they had received several complaints about Republican poll watchers last year.</p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">Mr. Hollins, the former Harris County clerk, said Republicans recognized that “Black and brown and poor and young people’’ use the flexible voting options more than others. “They’re scared of that,” he said.</p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">While Republican-controlled legislatures in Georgia and Arizona are passing new voting laws after Democratic victories in November, Texas is pushing new restrictions despite having backed former President Donald J. Trump by more than 600,000 votes. The effort reflects the dual realities confronting Republicans in the State Legislature: a base eager for changes to voting following Mr. Trump’s 2020 loss and a booming population that is growing more diverse.<span class=\"css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0\">  </span></p></div><aside class=\"css-ew4tgv\" aria-label=\"companion column\"></aside></div><div class=\"css-79elbk\" data-testid=\"photoviewer-wrapper\"><div class=\"css-z3e15g\" data-testid=\"photoviewer-wrapper-hidden\"></div><div data-testid=\"photoviewer-children\" class=\"css-1a48zt4 ehw59r15\"><figure class=\"css-jcw7oy e1g7ppur0\" aria-label=\"media\" role=\"group\"><div class=\"css-1xdhyk6 erfvjey0\"><span class=\"css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0\">Image</span><div class=\"css-zjzyr8\"><div data-testid=\"lazyimage-container\" style=\"height:257.77777777777777px\"></div></div></div><figcaption class=\"css-1l44abu ewdxa0s0\"><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"css-16f3y1r e13ogyst0\">Bryan Hughes sponsored the bill in the State Senate that seeks to add voting restrictions.</span><span class=\"css-cnj6d5 e1z0qqy90\"><span class=\"css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0\">Credit...</span><span>Jay Janner/Austin American-Statesman, via Associated Press</span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div class=\"css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn\"><div class=\"css-53u6y8\"><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">Senator Bryan Hughes, a Republican from northeastern Texas who sponsored the State Senate bill, defended it as part of a long effort to strengthen “election security” in Texas.</p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">“I realize there’s a big national debate now, and maybe we’re getting sucked into that, but this is not something new to Texas,” Mr. Hughes said in an interview. He said that lawmakers were seeking to roll back mail voting access because that process was more prone to fraud. He offered no proof, and <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/debunking-voter-fraud-myth\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">numerous studies</a> have shown that voter fraud in the United States is exceptionally rare.</p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">Mr. Hughes said that the proposed ban on drive-through voting stemmed from the difficulty of getting access for partisan poll watchers at the locations and that 24-hour voting was problematic because it was difficult to find poll watchers for overnight shifts.</p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">But many voters in Harris County, whose population of 4.7 million ranks third in the country and is bigger than 25 states’, see a different motive.</p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">Kristie Osi-Shackelford, a costume designer from Houston who was working temporary jobs during the pandemic to help support her family, used 24-hour voting because it offered her the flexibility she needed as she juggled work and raising her three children. She said that it had taken her less than 10 minutes.</p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">“I’m sure there are people who may not have gotten to vote in the last couple of elections, but they had the opportunity at night, and it’s kind of sad that the powers that be feel like that has to be taken away in order to, quote unquote, protect election integrity,” Ms. Osi-Shackelford said. “And I struggled to find words, because it’s so irritating, and I’m tired. I’m tired of hearing the same stuff and seeing the same stuff so blatantly over and over again for years.”</p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">Brittany Hyman, 35, was eight months pregnant as Election Day was drawing near and was also raising a 4-year-old. Fearful of Covid-19 but also of the sheer logistics of navigating a line at the polls, Ms. Hyman voted at one of the drive-through locations.</p></div><aside class=\"css-ew4tgv\" aria-label=\"companion column\"></aside></div><div class=\"css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn\"><div class=\"css-53u6y8\"><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">“Being able to drive-through vote was a savior for me,” Ms. Hyman said.

The Texas Supreme Court ruled against the Republicans in late October.</p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">Other provisions in the G.O.P. bill, while not aimed as directly at Harris County, will most likely still have the biggest impact in the state’s biggest county. One proposal, which calls for a uniform number of voting machines to be deployed in each precinct, could hamper the ability to deploy extra machines in densely populated areas.</p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">This month, in a further escalation of public pressure on legislators, Mayor Sylvester Turner of Houston, a Democrat, gathered more than a dozen speakers, including business executives, civil rights activists and former athletes, for a 90-minute news conference denouncing the bill.</p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">“What is happening here in Texas is a warning shot to the rest of the country,” said Lina Hidalgo, the Harris County judge and a Democrat who has pushed for continued expansion of voting access in the county. “First Georgia, then Texas, then it’s more and more states, and soon enough we will have taken the largest step back since Jim Crow.

Trump lost the election and was impeached for his role in the Capitol riot, democracy preservation groups <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/11/us/politics/trump-ethics-democracy-biden.html\" title=\"\">pointed with urgency</a> to what they called a last, best chance to address the holes in the Constitution exposed by his presidency.</p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">But a suite of legislative responses, like requiring the release of presidential tax returns and barring presidents from channeling government money to their private businesses, is now hostage in the Senate to a more public fight over voting rights. And competing priorities of President Biden’s may ensure that the moment to fortify constitutional guardrails that Mr. Trump plowed through may already have passed.</p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">Most Democrats and a coalition of watchdog groups say the <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/policy-solutions/annotated-guide-people-act-2021#t7-top\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ethics and voting rights sections</a> in a sprawling Senate bill known as the For the People Act, or S.1., should remain intact and entwined. But solid Republican opposition to the legislation’s voter access proposals threatens less debated elements in the measure, part of what was envisioned to be the most comprehensive ethics overhaul since Watergate.</p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">Even Democratic support for the bill has begun to splinter, as the <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2021/04/22/black-democrats-voting-rights-484089\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Congressional Black Caucus</a> and some advocacy groups pivot from the full 800-page legislation to pushing for narrower proposals.</p></div><aside class=\"css-ew4tgv\" aria-label=\"companion column\"></aside></div><div class=\"css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn\"><div class=\"css-53u6y8\"><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">“It’s hard to move many things simultaneously through the Senate, and you have a president who is rightly first focused on Covid relief and next focused on infrastructure,” said Max Stier, who leads the Partnership for Public Service, which champions a more effective federal work force. “I worry that important issues like ethics reform don’t make the cut.”</p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">The measure will undergo changes in a formal drafting on May 11 by the Senate Rules Committee that aims to clarify confusing provisions, conflicting deadlines and redundancies. Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the majority leader, <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.democrats.senate.gov/news/press-releases/majority-leader-schumer-floor-remarks-on-the-introduction-of-s1-the-for-the-people-act-in-the-senate-to-combat-voter-suppression-efforts-and-re-invigorate-american-democracy\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">vowed last month</a> to bring the full bill to a vote. “If our democracy doesn’t work, then we have no hope — no hope — of solving any of our other problems,” he said.</p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">The act would expand voting access, curb partisan gerrymandering and curtail the influence of secret donors, special interests and foreign governments in American elections, all hot-button issues that Republican leaders strongly oppose.</p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">“This is clearly an effort by one party to rewrite the rules of our political system,” Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/24/us/politics/voting-rights-senate.html\" title=\"\">said last month in a hearing on the bill</a>. “This legislation would forcibly rewrite the election laws in all 50 states.”</p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">The bill’s presidential ethics section is less contested. Major party candidates for president and vice president would have to release 10 years’ worth of personal and business tax returns. The president’s and vice president’s exemption from executive branch conflict-of-interest rules would end. Presidents would be required to place personal financial holdings in a blind trust or limit them to assets that pose no conflict. And federal spending at businesses owned or controlled by the president, vice president, cabinet or their family members would be tightly controlled.</p></div><aside class=\"css-ew4tgv\" aria-label=\"companion column\"></aside></div><div class=\"css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn\"><div class=\"css-53u6y8\"><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">To guard against a president pressuring appointees to interfere in government proceedings involving the president, it would require political appointees to turn such matters over to career staff. The act also addresses the Trump administration’s open flouting of ethics laws already on the books, by granting more power to enforcement bodies like the Office of Government Ethics.</p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">Such provisions have received scant public discussion, but with Republicans dead set against unrelated voting provisions, the legislation appears to have no chance of passing the Senate under current rules, which would require at least 10 Republicans to support it.</p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">“Someone could pull out the ethics portion and see if they could get support,” said Richard L. Hasen, a law and political science professor at the University of California, Irvine, and an expert in election and campaign finance law. “But usually it takes a scandal to get people moving on ethics reform.”</p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">And three months into the Biden era, the Trump presidency is already receding.</p></div><aside class=\"css-ew4tgv\" aria-label=\"companion column\"></aside></div><div class=\"css-79elbk\" data-testid=\"photoviewer-wrapper\"><div class=\"css-z3e15g\" data-testid=\"photoviewer-wrapper-hidden\"></div><div data-testid=\"photoviewer-children\" class=\"css-1a48zt4 ehw59r15\"><figure class=\"css-jcw7oy e1g7ppur0\" aria-label=\"media\" role=\"group\"><div class=\"css-1xdhyk6 erfvjey0\"><span class=\"css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0\">Image</span><picture><source media=\"(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)\" srcset=\"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/04/24/multimedia/24dc-ethics2/24dc-ethics2-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600\"></source><source media=\"(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)\" srcset=\"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/04/24/multimedia/24dc-ethics2/24dc-ethics2-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200\"></source><source media=\"(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)\" srcset=\"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/04/24/multimedia/24dc-ethics2/24dc-ethics2-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800\"></source><img alt=\"The act addresses the open flouting of ethics laws under the administration of President Donald J.

It takes aim at partisan gerrymandering by standardizing rules and opening the process of congressional redistricting to the public. The act would broaden disclosure requirements for campaign and presidential inaugural committee contributions by nonprofit groups and publicly listed companies.</p></div><aside class=\"css-ew4tgv\" aria-label=\"companion column\"></aside></div><div class=\"css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn\"><div class=\"css-53u6y8\"><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">Its ethics provisions go beyond the executive branch. It would require the entire federal judiciary, including Supreme Court justices, to create a code of ethics within a year of the bill’s enactment. It would tighten reporting and other rules governing lobbying on behalf of foreign governments.</p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">For Congress, the bill would impose fuller disclosure of lawmakers’ outside income, require congressional candidates to disclose whether individual campaign donors are lobbyists, prohibit House members from serving on the boards of for-profit companies, and bar House and Senate members and their staff aides from working to advance legislation that would benefit their or their families’ personal financial interests. It would also bar lawmakers from using taxpayer money to pay damages awarded in discrimination and sexual misconduct cases.</p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">“It’s critically important that the For the People Act remain big, bold and together,” said Aaron Scherb, the director of legislative affairs for Common Cause, one of several groups working with Democrats on the bill, adding, “People don’t want piecemeal solutions to comprehensive problems.”</p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">But insisting on it all, at this point, could mean getting nothing, and talk is percolating that the ethics measures should not be allowed to die with the broader bill. Danielle Brian, the executive director at the Project on Government Oversight, says the group has been working on salvaging some of the bill’s ethics proposals, some which might not need Congress at all.</p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">“We are focusing on pushing those ethics reforms that are in the bill that the Biden administration could be implementing without legislation, right away,” she said.</p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">For example, the group has been pressing for the creation of a centralized records database on the Office of Government Ethics public website that would open financial and other disclosures filed by executive branch nominees to greater scrutiny. Mr. Stier said the Partnership for Public Service had thrown its weight behind another Trump corrective, the Accountability for Acting Officials Act, which would prohibit acting agency chiefs from serving more than 120 days, and would require acting inspectors general to possess relevant qualifications.</p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">Ms. Brian’s group has advocated several ethics proposals contained in a separate, expansive ethics bill, the Protecting Our Democracy Act, which is being updated in the House. It, too, would require candidates for president to release 10 years of tax returns, while beefing up protections for whistle-blowers and inspectors general, barring presidents from pardoning themselves and prohibiting presidents and vice presidents from receiving gifts, called emoluments in the Constitution, from foreign nations without congressional consent.

I’m Lisa Lerer, </em><a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://twitter.com/llerer\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">your host</em></a><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">.</em></p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">As a college student, Joseph R. Biden Jr. was <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/17/us/politics/joe-biden-college-1960s.html\" title=\"\">more consumed with Corvettes</a> than with civil rights. A little more than a decade later, he made common cause with Southern Republicans in the Senate to slow school desegregation. One of his most significant legislative achievements was a 1994 crime bill that <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/25/us/joe-biden-crime-laws.html\" title=\"\">helped lay the groundwork</a> for the mass incarceration that has devastated America’s Black communities. And as vice president, he often ceded discussion of the complex dynamics of race to Barack Obama, the country’s first Black president.</p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">Yet through it all, Mr. Biden cast himself as staunch ally of racial justice, captivated and inspired at a young age by the battle for civil rights.</p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">“I wasn’t at the bridge at Selma,” he said <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/18/us/politics/18biden.html\" title=\"\">in an interview in 2008</a>, “but the struggle for civil rights was the animating political element of my life.”</p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">Well, that was then. Thirteen years later, race is an issue that Mr. Biden can no longer finesse quite as easily.</p></div><aside class=\"css-ew4tgv\" aria-label=\"companion column\"></aside></div><div class=\"css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn\"><div class=\"css-53u6y8\"><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">The killing of George Floyd last year reignited a civil rights movement, plunging the country into a deep reckoning over race. As president, Mr. Biden now leads a party that has made racial justice a defining element of its coalition, offering the country sweeping pledges to combat deep-seated prejudice and reform the criminal justice system.</p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">Unlike any other period in recent history, Democrats have infused their agenda with a focus on racial inequality, upending decades of conventional party wisdom that such appeals could prove politically risky.</p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">“The dream of justice for all will be deferred no longer,” Mr. Biden said during his inauguration address. “We can deliver racial justice.”</p><div id=\"NYT_MAIN_CONTENT_1_REGION\" class=\"css-9tf9ac\"><section id=\"styln-biden-admin-signup\" class=\"interactive-content interactive-size-scoop css-1d2m72r\"><div class=\"css-17ih8de interactive-body\"><!--\n\n======================================================\n\nTHIS IS A GENERATED TEMPLATE FILE.

Very big things, like correcting more than 400 years of systemic racism in America. Now that Democrats control Washington, how far they can move the government to make good on that vow offers one of the first tests of their campaign pledges.</p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">Activists say that Mr. Biden’s embrace of racial justice reflects how the country has changed. The president has always positioned himself at the center of his party, shifting his positions as Democrats marched to the left on issues including abortion, gun rights, criminal justice and race.</p></div><aside class=\"css-ew4tgv\" aria-label=\"companion column\"></aside></div><div class=\"css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn\"><div class=\"css-53u6y8\"><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">“Biden is actually being Biden by being inside of all of the ways in which the current landscape is sending him messages,” said Rashad Robinson, the president of Color of Change, a racial justice organization that was skeptical of Mr. Biden during the Democratic primary race but now praised some successes while believing much more needs to be done.<span class=\"css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0\">  </span>“That is good, but I don’t want to be classifying this as some sort of out-front radical leadership. That would really not represent everything that could be possible if we leaned in more.”</p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">Yet the Democratic decision to embrace racial issues is not without political peril, given how deeply these matters have come to be defined by partisan divides. While the country’s views on race have shifted, <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/20/us/george-floyd-protests-police-reform.html?smid=tw-share\" title=\"\">it’s an open question</a> as to how much white liberals and independents would support efforts to truly unwind some of the broader systems — like segregated schools and neighborhoods — that reinforce racial inequality.</p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\"><a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://osf.io/tdkf3/\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">A new paper by political scientists at Yale</a> found that support for progressive policies — like raising the minimum wage, forgiving student loan debt and the Green New Deal — actually declines when Democrats frame their arguments in racial terms, despite the shift in public opinion on the topic.</p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">“Democrats’ use of racial frames in describing their progressive policies may inadvertently make it harder for them to adopt public policies that will advance racial justice,” the Yale researchers write.</p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">Mr. Biden is far from the only Democrat speaking more explicitly about race. After George Floyd, many Democratic voters and politicians found themselves getting a crash course in racial inequality. Some of the efforts to show solidarity were ham-handed, at best: When Democrats released legislation to overhaul policing last June, they did so <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/culture/on-and-off-the-avenue/the-embarrassment-of-democrats-wearing-kente-cloth-stoles\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">draped in cringe-worthy</a> kente cloth stoles. Even this past week, Speaker Nancy Pelosi offered a tone-deaf response to the guilty verdict against Derek Chauvin by thanking Mr. Floyd for “sacrificing” his life, seeming to imply that the victim of police violence had a choice in the matter.</p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">But during the campaign, Mr. Biden “did the work,” as liberal activists would say, despite his occasional gaffes when talking about race and Black Americans. He apologized for portions of the 1994 crime bill. His campaign released a <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://joebiden.com/racial-economic-equity/\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">comprehensive plan</a> to address racial disparities on issues ranging from health to policing, with a particular focus on advancing economic equality, increasing access to affordable housing and education and reforming the criminal justice system.</p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">Since taking office, Mr. Biden has vowed to <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/23/business/biden-equity-racial-gender.html\" title=\"\">make racial equity central</a> to every element of his agenda — from his response to the coronavirus pandemic to where infrastructure is built to how climate policies are crafted. </p></div><aside class=\"css-ew4tgv\" aria-label=\"companion column\"></aside></div><div class=\"css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn\"><div class=\"css-53u6y8\"><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">This week, the <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/21/us/politics/justice-department-minneapolis-police.html\" title=\"\">Justice Department</a> announced a sweeping investigation into the Minneapolis Police Department, a sign that the Biden administration will apply stricter federal oversight to local police forces. And in a <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/20/us/politics/biden-harris-chauvin-verdict-speech.html\" title=\"\">speech</a> on Tuesday night, Mr. Biden <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/21/us/politics/congress-police-reform.html\" title=\"\">formally called on lawmakers to resurrect</a> the Democratic bill known as the <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/7120\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">George Floyd Justice in Policing Act</a>, which seeks to address racial discrimination and the use of excessive force. The president pledged to sign it into law “as quickly as possible.”</p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">A fair number of voters believe those actions aren’t enough: Forty-two percent of Americans say Mr. Biden is doing “too little” to reform police practices in the country, while 32 percent say he has done the right amount and 15 percent say he has done “too much,” according to a new <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/context/april-18-21-2021-washington-post-abc-news-poll/72d8dab8-8a54-4468-a964-b7326876814d/?itid=lk_inline_manual_3\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Washington Post-ABC News poll</a>. Nearly half of Black Americans and Democrats say Biden has done too little on the issue, a significant break from their strong support of his agenda on other issues.</p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">Republicans see an opportunity to campaign on some of those fears. In 2020, the party found some success by characterizing moderate Democrats in swing districts as anti-law-enforcement and supportive of violent protests, saying they supported calls from the left to “defund the police.” Since then, Republicans have leaned into that messaging, with G.O.P.-controlled state legislatures passing bills to reduce voting access, empower the police and <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/21/us/politics/republican-anti-protest-laws.html\" title=\"\">target protesters</a>.</p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">The response to Mr. Floyd’s killing provided more evidence that Republicans see political opportunities in this moment of reckoning. While many Republicans stayed silent on the Chauvin verdict, some of those who responded showed an unwillingness to let reality get in the way of what they see as a good political talking point. Even as <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/derek-chauvin-verdict-reaction/2021/04/20/58086c4a-a21d-11eb-85fc-06664ff4489d_story.html\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">worries of unrest dissipated into a pained sort of celebration</a>, some in the G.O.P. kept their focus firmly on the violence that didn’t happen on Tuesday evening.</p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">On Fox News, Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida implied that the guilty verdict could have happened because “the jury is scared of what a mob may do.”</p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">The idea that rioting “is going to influence how the rule of law is applied — would be a total disaster if that idea takes hold,” he said.</p></div><aside class=\"css-ew4tgv\" aria-label=\"companion column\"></aside></div><div></div><div class=\"css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn\"><div class=\"css-53u6y8\"><hr class=\"css-7daw59 e1mu4ftr0\"></div><aside class=\"css-ew4tgv\" aria-label=\"companion column\"></aside></div><div class=\"css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn\"><div class=\"css-53u6y8\"><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\"><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\">Drop us a line!</strong></p></div><aside class=\"css-ew4tgv\" aria-label=\"companion column\"></aside></div><div class=\"css-79elbk\" data-testid=\"photoviewer-wrapper\"><div class=\"css-z3e15g\" data-testid=\"photoviewer-wrapper-hidden\"></div><div data-testid=\"photoviewer-children\" class=\"css-1a48zt4 ehw59r15\"><figure class=\"css-jcw7oy e1g7ppur0\" aria-label=\"media\" role=\"group\"><div class=\"css-1xdhyk6 erfvjey0\"><span class=\"css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0\">Image</span><picture><source media=\"(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)\" srcset=\"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/01/01/us/politics/onpolitics-spring/onpolitics-spring-still-mobileMasterAt3x.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600\"></source><source media=\"(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)\" srcset=\"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/01/01/us/politics/onpolitics-spring/onpolitics-spring-still-mobileMasterAt3x.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200\"></source><source media=\"(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)\" srcset=\"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/01/01/us/politics/onpolitics-spring/onpolitics-spring-still-mobileMasterAt3x.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800\"></source><img class=\"css-1m50asq\" src=\"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/01/01/us/politics/onpolitics-spring/onpolitics-spring-articleLarge.gif?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale\" srcset=\"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/01/01/us/politics/onpolitics-spring/onpolitics-spring-articleLarge.gif?quality=90&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/01/01/us/politics/onpolitics-spring/onpolitics-spring-jumbo.gif?quality=90&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/01/01/us/politics/onpolitics-spring/onpolitics-spring-superJumbo.gif?quality=90&amp;auto=webp 1575w\" sizes=\"((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 60vw, 100vw\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></div><figcaption class=\"css-1l44abu ewdxa0s0\"></figcaption></figure></div></div><div class=\"css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn\"><div class=\"css-53u6y8\"><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">We want to hear from our readers.

(5, 'Thelma Harper, ‘Transformative’ Tennessee Legislator, Dies at 80', 'She was the first African-American woman elected to the State Senate, and she was its longest-serving female senator when she retired in 2018.', '<div class=\"css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn\"><div class=\"css-53u6y8\"><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">Thelma Harper, a Democrat who became the first African-American woman elected to Tennessee’s State Senate, died on Thursday. She was 80.</p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">The death was confirmed by her daughter, Linda Harper. She did not say where her mother died or what the cause was.</p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">Ms. Harper entered the Senate in 1989 and was the state’s longest-serving female senator by the time she retired, in 2018.</p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">“Whether she was fighting landfills for her neighbors, serving a community organization or leading a hearing in the legislature, Thelma Harper was a strong voice for her community, for justice and our most vulnerable children,” the State Senate’s Democratic Caucus said in a statement.</p></div><aside class=\"css-ew4tgv\" aria-label=\"companion column\"></aside></div><div class=\"css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn\"><div class=\"css-53u6y8\"><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">Ms. Harper was the first chair of the Tennessee Black Caucus. In the mid-2000s she successfully pushed to have a stretch of U.S. Highway 41 in Nashville renamed in honor of the civil rights hero Rosa Parks.</p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">She also had a national presence. In 2000 she introduced Vice President Al Gore, the presidential nominee, at the Democratic National Convention at Madison Square Garden in New York in a speech called “The Al Gore I Know,” in which she described his time as an elected official in Tennessee.</p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">“Like many families,” she <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.c-span.org/video/?c4743807/user-clip-al-gore-state-senator-thelma-harper\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">said in the speech</a>, “when we called upon Al Gore, he always listened to our voices. He always responded to our needs. And he always fought on our side.”</p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">In 2008, she was a leader in Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign in Tennessee.</p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">Lt. Gov. Randy McNally, a Republican, called Ms. Harper a “transformative public figure,” “a fierce advocate for her constituents and the city of Nashville” and a role model. In a tribute on Twitter, he made reference to her fondness for eye-catching hats.</p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">“Today the legendary Thelma Harper traded in her signature hat for a halo,” he wrote.</p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">Thelma Harper was born on Dec. 2, 1940, in Brentwood, Tenn., just south of Nashville.

And he acknowledged that it would mean working closely with the international community, which was thrown for a loop after President Donald J. Trump reneged on the United States’ commitment to the Paris climate accord.</p></div><aside class=\"css-ew4tgv\" aria-label=\"companion column\"></aside></div><div class=\"css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn\"><div class=\"css-53u6y8\"><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">“Scientists tell us that this is the decisive decade,” Mr. Biden said. “This is the decade we must make decisions that will avoid the worst consequences of a climate crisis.”</p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">While environmental activists mostly welcomed the news, saying the commitment comes at least somewhere close to matching the scale of the problem, experts have cautioned that Mr. Biden’s target is just what Ms. Granholm says it is: a moonshot. That was underscored by a report released just days ago by the International Energy Agency, which found that <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/20/climate/coal-climate-change.html\" title=\"\">demand for coal is still on the rise</a> around the world.</p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">To get a handle on how Mr. Biden’s international commitments will need to jibe with his domestic policy agenda, I called <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.edf.org/people/nathaniel-keohane\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Nathaniel Keohane</a>, the economist and former Obama adviser who now serves as senior vice president for climate at the Environmental Defense Fund. The interview has been lightly edited and condensed.</p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\"><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\">Hi Nathaniel. From the environmental community’s perspective, how expected or unexpected was Biden’s pledge to cut U.S. greenhouse gas emissions to half of their 2005 levels by 2030?</strong></p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">Well, this matched the level of ambition that we’ve been calling for, and that the business community has been calling for: at least 50 percent. We’re seeing an administration that is willing to go bold when the moment demands it. We’ve seen this across the board in other areas of policy, and we’re seeing it in climate change now. The president clearly meant it when he said that the climate crisis is one of the four crises he is going to be focused on in his presidency. There’s obviously huge amounts of work to be done to implement that target, but in terms of the level of ambition, that’s what we needed. It’s in line with the president’s target of net zero emissions by 2050, which is what the science demands.</p></div><aside class=\"css-ew4tgv\" aria-label=\"companion column\"></aside></div><div class=\"css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn\"><div class=\"css-53u6y8\"><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">And it’s also at least in the top tier of ambition globally — not quite as ambitious, of course, as the E.U.; not nearly as ambitious as the U.K. But it compares favorably with the rest of the world, and it puts the U.S. in the top tier, which is where it should be as the largest historical emitter over time and as the second-largest emitter today.</p></div><aside class=\"css-ew4tgv\" aria-label=\"companion column\"></aside></div><div></div><div class=\"css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn\"><div class=\"css-53u6y8\"><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\"><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\">How much trouble is Biden going to have in taking a leadership role with the international community after Trump withdrew the United States from the Paris climate accord?</strong></p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">It is a real issue. There’s a credibility deficit that the United States faces. I think President Biden and his team understand that, and they’re conscious of doing what they can to address it. This kind of ambitious target is a good first step. But I think some of that skepticism and wariness will persist until this administration can put in place some real concrete policies that will help achieve that 50 percent reduction.</p><div role=\"complementary\" aria-labelledby=\"storyline-latest-updates\" class=\"css-y1f5ai\"><div class=\"css-8atqhb\"><div class=\"css-nl7gl3\"><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/section/climate\">Biden’s Climate Push<!-- --> ›</a></div><h2 id=\"storyline-latest-updates\" class=\"css-5o8lnh\"><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/04/23/us/earth-day-climate-summit-biden\">Live Updates: Global Climate Summit</a></h2><div class=\"css-rchdvv\"><time class=\"css-101kej7\" datetime=\"2021-04-23T22:25:23.000Z\"><span>Updated </span><div class=\"css-ki347z\"><span class=\"css-1stvlmo\">April 23, 2021, 6:25 p.m. ET</span><span class=\"css-kpxlkr\"></span></div></time><span class=\"css-1dv1kvn\" aria-live=\"polite\"></span></div><ul class=\"css-15zvb7e\"><li class=\"css-1l8wklm\"><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/04/23/us/earth-day-climate-summit-biden#gavin-newsom-california-fracking\">California’s governor seeks to ban new fracking and halt oil production, but not immediately.</a></li><li class=\"css-1l8wklm\"><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/04/23/us/earth-day-climate-summit-biden#arizona-republican-recount\">An Arizona judge temporarily halts a G.O.P. effort to recount 2020 ballots.</a></li><li class=\"css-1l8wklm\"><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/04/23/us/earth-day-climate-summit-biden#biden-meets-virtually-with-the-pentagons-senior-military-and-civilian-leaders\">Biden meets virtually with the Pentagon’s senior military and civilian leaders.</a></li></ul><div class=\"styln-survey-component\" id=\"storyline-survey-latest-updates\"></div></div></div><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">You heard Xi Jinping, the president of China, in his speech yesterday making a thinly veiled allusion to this, talking about the importance of countries continuing in a straight path and being consistent rather than going back and forth.

Looking at his next big priority — a landmark infrastructure package — to what degree could that legislation help to set the United States on a new course?</strong></p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">The infrastructure bill is crucial. It’s going to be the first big test of whether he does what Bill talked about — which is making climate central to the focus of his presidency. The other way of saying it is that you need a whole-of-government approach. </p></div><aside class=\"css-ew4tgv\" aria-label=\"companion column\"></aside></div><div class=\"css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn\"><div class=\"css-53u6y8\"><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">It is vital that the infrastructure bill include a massive investment in low-carbon and clean-energy technologies and infrastructure; supporting the deployment of electric vehicles and electric-vehicle infrastructure; supporting a cleaner grid, more transmission; supporting supply chains to make sure that electric vehicles and batteries are produced here at home. It is really going to be necessary for the administration to lean in.</p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">If the bill is <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/22/business/biden-infrastructure-spending.html\" title=\"\">split into two parts</a>, then the administration is going to need to be willing to make sure that one of those is something that reflects the urgency of the moment, in terms of investment in low-carbon and clean-energy infrastructure — as well as in <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.c2es.org/content/climate-resilience-overview/#:~:text=Climate%20resilience%20is%20the%20ability,better%20cope%20with%20these%20risks.\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">climate resilience</a>, because this is an issue that affects the entire economy.</p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">The other reason the infrastructure bill is so important is that for the Biden administration to succeed in this effort — for it to become durable politically, so it doesn’t flip-flop back and forth in the way we were just talking about — the administration needs to show that investments in clean energy are also investments that create jobs, that drive the economy, that lead to cleaner air and healthier communities, especially in frontline disadvantaged communities that have borne the brunt of pollution historically. The Biden administration needs to show that a low-carbon agenda is also one that brings better outcomes for people in their everyday lives. And that’s what infrastructure spending, in some ways, can do most of all.</p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">I think if they do that, and you see the economy rebounding in the coming years and you see that in the context of real investment in clean energy and low-carbon transition, that will help build the political will and the popular support to keep pushing on climate and clean energy over the coming decade.</p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">Put more simply, you don’t get the 50 percent cut by 2030 without putting climate and clean energy at the center of this infrastructure bill this year.</p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\"><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\">What about the fact that some states have been doing a much stronger job than the federal government at leading the way on clean-energy policy? To what degree have states been modeling policies that the federal government can adopt, and how much does Biden’s team still need to innovate its own solutions?</strong></p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">The states are going to play a critical role — they <em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">have</em> played a critical role. Not just states, but cities and companies. The last four years, when Washington, D.C., was out of the picture, cities and states and companies carried the load. And states in particular, as you say, have really led the way on innovative policies to drive down emissions and carry their economies forward: California and New York, but also Colorado — which has the toughest economy-wide statutory target on emissions in the country. You’ve got Hawaii pioneering the way in renewable energy. This is happening across New England, it’s happening in the Midwest.</p></div><aside class=\"css-ew4tgv\" aria-label=\"companion column\"></aside></div><div class=\"css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn\"><div class=\"css-53u6y8\"><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">But the states can’t do it alone.

That can be a model for doing it at a federal level. So the policy models are there, and states can lead the way in that sense. But it’s going to require federal action if we’re going to get to that 50 percent cut by 2030. This needs to be an all-of-government approach that employs all the levers we have.</p></div><aside class=\"css-ew4tgv\" aria-label=\"companion column\"></aside></div><div></div><div class=\"css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn\"><div class=\"css-53u6y8\"><p class=\"css-pncxxs etfikam0\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">On Politics is also available as a newsletter. </em><a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/politics\" title=\"\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">Sign up here</em></a><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\"> to get it delivered to your inbox.</em></p><p class=\"css-pncxxs etfikam0\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">Is there anything you think we’re missing?

(7, 'California’s governor seeks to ban new fracking and halt oil production, but not immediately.', 'In the past, Gov. Gavin Newsom has said he lacked the executive authority to halt fracking, which has long been a source of both pollution and higher-paying jobs in California.', '<div class=\"css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn\"><div class=\"css-53u6y8\"><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">Gov. Gavin Newsom of California announced a plan on Friday to ban hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, by 2024 and to consider phasing out oil production statewide by 2045.</p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">The announcement, on the heels of Earth Day, came as a petition for Mr. Newsom’s recall was expected to qualify for the ballot. In the past, the governor <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-lS3_v2sCk\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">has said</a> he lacked the executive authority to halt fracking, which has long been a source of both pollution and higher-paying, blue-collar jobs in California.</p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">Mr. Newsom campaigned on a promise to ban fracking, and in September asked Democrats in the Legislature to send a bill to his desk that would do so. But some Democrats criticized him later for failing to promote it sufficiently. Last week, a sweeping bill incorporating that ban and other fossil-fuel regulations was blocked by industry lobbyists and moderate Democrats seeking to protect paychecks in the oil-rich San Joaquin Valley.</p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">“The climate crisis is real, and we continue to see the signs every day,” the governor said in a statement on Friday. “As we move to swiftly decarbonize our transportation sector and create a healthier future for our children, I’ve made it clear I don’t see a role for fracking in that future and, similarly, believe that California needs to move beyond oil.”</p></div><aside class=\"css-ew4tgv\" aria-label=\"companion column\"></aside></div><div class=\"css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn\"><div class=\"css-53u6y8\"><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">Politically, Mr. Newsom’s ban and its gradual timeline were viewed as a way to appease the progressive voters he will need should the recall effort lead to a special election, as expected, while preventing the deep-pocketed oil industry from throwing its weight behind the recall.</p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">The proposed moves, which would ban new fracking permits starting in 2024 and require more rigorous review of current permit applications, will involve a lengthy rule-making process by regulatory agencies such as the California Air Resources Board and the state Department of Conservation. The announcement does not affect existing fracking operations, which are already considerably diminished and now account for about 17 percent of California’s oil and gas production.</p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">Nonetheless, Mr. Newsom’s plan was slammed by labor groups representing refinery workers and by oil industry trade groups, who vowed to fight it.</p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">“Banning nearly 20 percent of the energy production in our state will only hurt workers, families and communities in California and turns our energy independence over to foreign suppliers,” Catherine Reheis-Boyd, chief executive of the Western States Petroleum Association, <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.wspa.org/resource/wspa-statement-on-california-governors-fracking-ban/\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">said in a statement</a>.</p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">Environmental groups, meanwhile, praised the announcement only faintly.</p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">“It’s historic and globally significant that Governor Newsom has committed California to phase out fossil-fuel production and ban fracking, but we don’t have time for studies and delays,” said Kassie Siegel, director of the Center for Biological Diversity’s Climate Law Institute.</p></div><aside class=\"css-ew4tgv\" aria-label=\"companion column\"></aside></div>', 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/04/23/us/23new-washington-briefing-newsom/merlin_186815406_7e2fff39-831c-4086-86dc-f4a7460baaee-thumbWide.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale', 'https://www.nytimes.com//2021/04/23/us/politics/gavin-newsom-california-fracking.html', 1, 1, '2021-04-25 04:10:49', '2021-04-25 04:10:49'),
